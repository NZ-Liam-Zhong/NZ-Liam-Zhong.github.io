        The Photo with Prof.Shanmin Li was taken after an afternoon conversation with him. He taught me to be self-descipline in order to be a successful entrepreneur. He taught me that "Character is revealed in small matters; principles are revealed in large ones“。He also taught me the importance of etiquette and being mindful of how others feel.
